# ML Projects Repository
This repository contains various projects and experiments in Machine Learning, ranging from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model building, training, and evaluation. It includes:

- *Data analysis:* EDA, data cleaning, and transformations.
- *Modeling:* Classical ML algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, SVM).
- *Hyperparameter tuning:* Experiments with model optimization techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.
- *Model evaluation:* Metrics, confusion matrices, cross-validation, etc.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and share your ideas!
